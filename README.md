https://jamesbachini.github.io/GiveForever/

Live on Ethereum mainnet and Goerli testnet

This project creates a vault which can be used to deposit ETH which gets converted via Lido Finance to stETH. These liquid staking tokens represent a staked Ethereum position earning around 5% APR yield currently. At any point any user can withdraw surplus funds accrued from staking rewards to the charity address which is set in the contract.
